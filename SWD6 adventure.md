## Negotiating and gathering intel

Certainly! Let's incorporate a puzzle into the negotiation challenge involving two informants. The puzzle requires the players to gather information from both informants to piece together the details needed for the negotiation.

**Negotiation Challenge with Puzzle:**

The players, seeking information on Teemo's demands for releasing the defector, discover that two informants, Jax Marrick and Selina Vos, each hold a crucial piece of the puzzle.

1. **Jax Marrick's Information:**

   - _Location:_ Jax frequents the darker corners of Mos Eisley cantina, known for his shadowy dealings.
   - _Piece of the Puzzle:_ Jax possesses details about Teemo's personal interests and quirks, which can be exploited during negotiation. However, he won't share this information directly; instead, he'll provide a cryptic riddle hinting at Teemo's preferences.

2. **Selina Vos's Information:**
   - _Location:_ Selina is a skilled slicer and hangs out near the spaceport's data terminals, picking up scraps of information.
   - _Piece of the Puzzle:_ Selina has intercepted a coded message regarding Teemo's current business dealings. The message hints at the specific conditions under which Teemo might be willing to release the defector.

**The Puzzle:**

- The players need to gather both pieces of information to understand Teemo's demands fully.
- Jax's riddle, when solved, reveals a specific aspect of Teemo's personality that can be exploited during negotiation.
- Selina's coded message, when decrypted, provides details about Teemo's recent business dealings and the conditions under which he might be open to negotiation.

**Player Challenges:**

- Interacting with Jax to get the riddle without revealing their true intentions.
- Deciphering the coded message from Selina's data terminal, possibly involving a skill check or using a slicer droid to assist.

**Negotiation Outcome:**

- Armed with both pieces of information, the players can approach Teemo with a more nuanced understanding of how to negotiate effectively, increasing their chances of a successful outcome.

This puzzle adds an interactive and cerebral element to the negotiation challenge, requiring players to engage with the environment and use their problem-solving skills to gather the necessary information.

## Getting into the palace

Certainly! Here are four alternative ways the players could approach infiltrating Teemo's palace, avoiding the front door:

1. **Sewer Access:**

   - _Description:_ A network of sewers runs beneath Mos Eisley, and there is a concealed access point near the outskirts of the palace. The players can navigate through the dark and cramped tunnels to emerge inside the palace, avoiding initial security measures.
   - _Challenge:_ The sewers are home to dangerous creatures and potentially rival factions. Players must navigate carefully and might encounter unexpected obstacles or enemies.

2. **Smuggler's Passage:**

   - _Description:_ Mos Eisley is known for its hidden passages and smuggler routes. The players could seek out a local contact who knows of a secret entrance used by smugglers, providing them a discreet way into Teemo's palace.
   - _Challenge:_ Locating the right contact and gaining their trust could involve completing a favor, solving a local dispute, or convincing the contact that the Rebellion's cause is worth supporting.

3. **Disguised Delivery Crew:**

   - _Description:_ Teemo's palace regularly receives shipments. The players could acquire or create a convincing disguise as delivery personnel, using crates or containers to conceal their true identity. This approach allows them to enter with minimal suspicion.
   - _Challenge:_ The players need to either intercept an existing delivery or create a plausible cover story to be accepted as part of the palace's delivery crew.

4. **Upper-level Balcony Infiltration:**
   - _Description:_ The palace has a series of upper-level balconies overlooking a courtyard. The players might discover a hidden path or climb their way up to the balconies, providing a vantage point to observe the palace layout and access less guarded entry points.
   - _Challenge:_ Climbing or accessing the upper levels requires agility and stealth. Once on the balcony, players need to navigate discreetly to avoid detection by guards or surveillance systems.

These alternative approaches give the players diverse options for entering Teemo's palace, encouraging creativity and allowing them to choose a method that aligns with their skills and resources.

## Traps

Certainly! Here are three examples of hidden traps that the players might encounter during the palace infiltration:

1. **Thermal Sensor Alarm:**

   - _Description:_ As the players navigate a dimly lit corridor, they come across a section with hidden thermal sensors. If body heat is detected, alarms will be triggered, alerting Teemo's guards.
   - _Challenge:_ Players need to find a way to bypass the thermal sensors. This could involve using thermal cloaks, disabling the sensors temporarily, or finding an alternate route.

2. **Gas Vent Trap:**

   - _Description:_ In a seemingly ordinary chamber, there are concealed vents connected to a gas system. If triggered, toxic gas will be released, incapacitating anyone inside.
   - _Challenge:_ Players must carefully examine the room for signs of the trap or find a way to disable it before entering. This could involve hacking into the palace's security system or locating a control panel.

3. **False Floor Pitfall:**
   - _Description:_ A section of the floor in a grand hall appears solid, but it's actually a false floor covering a pitfall. Falling in would lead to a lower level, where Teemo's guards are stationed.
   - _Challenge:_ Players need to discern the safe path across the hall, either by using their wits, spotting subtle differences in the floor, or finding a hidden switch that temporarily reveals the true path.

These traps add an element of suspense and strategy to the infiltration, encouraging players to think creatively and utilize their skills to navigate Teemo's palace safely.

## Skirmish conclusion

Certainly! Let's incorporate a skirmish or attack during the "Palace Infiltration" to add some action to the adventure:

4. **Defector's Revelation & Ambush:**

   - After successfully navigating the palace and reaching the room where the defector is held, the players have a tense encounter with Teemo's guards. The defector reveals vital information about an imminent Imperial attack on Mos Eisley, adding urgency to their mission.

   - **Imperial Ambush:**

     - As the players prepare to leave with the defector, Imperial stormtroopers, led by an ambitious officer named Lieutenant Draven Korr, launch a surprise attack on Teemo's palace. The Imperials are aware of the Rebellion's interest in the defector and want to eliminate both threats.

   - **Skirmish Details:**

     - The players must now navigate a chaotic battle within the palace. Teemo's guards are engaged with the Imperials, creating opportunities for the players to either join the fray, slip away unnoticed, or use the distraction to negotiate with Teemo.

   - **Player Choices:**
     - Players can choose to fight alongside Teemo's guards against the Imperials, leveraging the chaos to ensure a safe escape.
     - Alternatively, they might decide to negotiate with Teemo in the midst of the battle, using the Imperial attack as leverage to secure the defector's release.
     - The players could also attempt a stealthy exit, taking advantage of the confusion to slip away without engaging in the skirmish directly.

This addition introduces a dynamic element to the climax of the adventure, allowing players to choose their approach based on their playstyle and the information they've gathered throughout the mission.
